Section B: Practical Questions

NumPy
9. Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 1 to 9 using NumPy.
10. Given a NumPy array, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], calculate the mean, standard deviation, and variance.
11. Generate a random 5x5 matrix and replace all values greater than 0.5 with 1, and the rest with 0.
12. Create a function that computes the inverse of a matrix using NumPy without using the built-in numpy.linalg.inv() function.

Pandas
13. Create a DataFrame from a dictionary containing lists and display the first 5 rows.
14. Filter a DataFrame to select rows where a specific column value is greater than a threshold.
15. Group the data by a column and calculate the mean for each group. Provide the code and output.

Matplotlib
16. Plot a line graph for x = [1, 2, 3, 4] and y = [10, 20, 25, 30]. Label the axes and add a title.
17. Create a bar chart using Matplotlib to compare the sales of three products across four quarters. Label the bars and add a legend.

Seaborn
18. Create a scatter plot using Seaborn with tips dataset where total_bill is on the x-axis and tip is on the y-axis. Color the points based on the time of day (Lunch/Dinner).
19. Create a heatmap using Seaborn to display the correlation matrix of the iris dataset.
