1. Create a 1D NumPy array containing the numbers 1 to 10.

2. Create a 2D array with shape (3, 4) filled with zeros.

3. Create a 3x3 identity matrix.

4. Create a 1D array of 10 random numbers and find the maximum and minimum values.

5. Create a 2D array and find the sum of all elements along the rows and columns.

6. Generate a 5x5 array of random integers between 10 and 50.

7. Create a random array of shape (3, 4) and normalize it (i.e., scale the values so that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1).

8. Create a 1D array of 12 elements and reshape it into a 3x4 matrix.

9. Flatten a 2D array into a 1D array.

10. Create a 3x3 matrix and print the element at row 2, column 3.

11. Create a 3D array of shape (2, 3, 4) and access the element at position (1, 2, 3).

12. Slice the 2D array to get the first two rows and the last two columns.

13. Create two arrays, one with shape (3, 1) and the other with shape (1, 4). Use broadcasting to add them.

14. Multiply a 2D array by a 1D array using broadcasting.

15. Create a 4x4 array of random numbers and replace all values greater than 0.5 with 1.

16. Create a 5x5 identity matrix and add a 5x5 matrix of ones to it.

17. Create a 3D array of shape (2, 3, 4) and reverse the order of elements along the third axis.

18. Create a 2D array of shape (4, 5) and calculate the mean of each row.

19. Create an array of 20 random integers between 1 and 100. Sort the array and find the median value.

20. Create two 1D arrays and use broadcasting to compute the outer product.
