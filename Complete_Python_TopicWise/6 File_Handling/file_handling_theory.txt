eg. audio_file , Vedio_file, image_file , pdf_file.

what is file handling ?
File handling means :

opening a file.
Performing some operations on it.
closing a file.

File Handling Modes--> mode specifies the purpose of opening file (r,w,a,x,r+,w+,a+)

1.text mode--> In this mode when you open the file , python treats its content as str type .

When you get the data from a text mode file , python first decodes the raw bytes using either a platform dependent encoding or specified encoding

2.binary mode --> In the binary mode python uses the data without any encoding because its content is treated as bytes . Eg. images , audios , vedios etc
(rb,wb,ab,xb,rb+,wb+,ab+)
