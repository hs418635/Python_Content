1.why people use python--

1.software quality--oops
2.developer productivity--less to type,less to debug,maintain
3.program portability--can run to different platefrom
4.libraries--huge no of libraries--can integrated--ai,ml,ds,iot
5.easy to learn

2.who use python
google--web search system
you tube--video sharing purposes
dropbox--space/storage/cloud
raspberrypi--projects
netflix-
intel,cisco,hp,ibm--


3.Application--
1.software development
2.system programming
3.gui
4.internet scripting(clint & sever)
5.mysql
6.nlp
7.ai/ml/dl
8.image processing
9.games
10.controlling of robot

python--it is an object oriented interpreted programming language.
1985-1990
Guido van Russom---comedy series character name monty python--python

features:-
	simple
	open source
	high level
	easy to learn
	huge libraries
	platefrom dependent


1.it is multi paradigm programming language because it can be used with the web interprise & web
services, mobile, application ,big data/cloud.

2.python makes the development and debugging fast since there is no complilation process.


shell mode--command prompt--run--but can't save(black window)
script mode--editors--write+run+save


always extension will be .py


backgroud process-->source code>>interpreation>>execute

modules--block of codes--in others language it is header files
ex--import math
math.sqrt(81)
sqare
ln
exp
sin
cos


1st--source code>complied>complier>complied code with extension .pyc>>interpreter>excute>o/p
 line by line

if it is second time and i didn't make any changes in souce code then source>>interpreter>>op


#memory allocation
a=10--variable defination--address-with id method
ex--10
id(10)
a=10
id(a)

#python object types--we don't refer it as datatypes.

programs are composed of modules.
modules contain statements
statements contain expressions
expression creates and process object.


builtin types--
numbers
strings
dictionary
list
tuple
set
boolean
none

program unit type--
functions
modules
classes
objects
