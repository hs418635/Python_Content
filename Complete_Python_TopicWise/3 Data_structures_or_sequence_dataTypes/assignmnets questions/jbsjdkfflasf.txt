# Q1.Given the string s = "Python Programming", extract the substring "Programming".
s = "Python Programming"

# Q2.Convert the string s = "Data Science" to uppercase and count the number of characters in the resulting string.
s = "Data Science"

# Q3.Given the string s = " Hello, World! ", remove the leading and trailing whitespace, and then check if the resulting string starts with "Hello".
s = " Hello, World! "

# Q4.Replace all occurrences of the substring "is" with "was" in the string s = "This is a test. This is only a test.".
s = "This is a test.This is only a test."
